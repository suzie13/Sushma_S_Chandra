        title: "Overview"
        body: "The goal of the 3D object detection is to obtain the 3D location, size and orientation of the detected object. 
        This is particularly useful for autonomous driving where accurate knowledge of the 3D environmentment is essential
        to make navigation decisions. Sensor fusion is incorporated in this project where data from both the velodyne Lidar sensor
        and camera is used. While cameras offer rich visual information that can be utilized for object recognition and classification, 
        LIDAR delivers precise depth information about the surroundings.
