        body: " This project is built from scratch with minimal use of black-box libraries. <br>
        The motivation for this project was child safety, when left alone at home, are in danger <br>
        of speedy moving objects and an alert can be sent to the parent. The algorithm can also <br>
        detect any object (of any size, shape, color, both living and non-living objects). It can also <br>
        be used to detect elderly people falling down. This application can particularly prove to be <br>
        useful in regions prone to earthquakes, and also at construction sites. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        This project integrates a static background and utilizes a single point perspective camera view.

        The algorithm's computational demands are significantly reduced as it avoids the use of neural networks. <br>
        Consequently, it can swiftly track objects in real-time, proving particularly advantageous when rapid <br>
        detections are essential in this specific application.This project is camera type independent where <br>
        the resolution doesnâ€™t affect the algorithm and image processing and even low resolution <br>
        video can perform the task efficiently. Each step can be depicted visually, enhancing <br>
        transparency and facilitating better comprehension and understanding of each individual <br>
        action. <br>

        This algorithm can be broken down into four main steps, namely motion masking, <br>
        connected component labelling, object id and tracking, and speed filter. In motion <br>
        masking the pixel intensities are compared between frames, in connected component <br>
        labelling different objects get different labels, then a unique id is extracted for unique <br>
        objects and are tracking by calculating the similarity score of each object. Lastly, a speed <br>
        filter is applied to only track those objects which are not just moving but having a <br>
        speedy motion.

        Machine learning can be used for object similarity <br>
        Eliminate shadow tracking <br>
        Use other technique like edge detection like OpenCV Canny Edge Detection <br>
        Instead of bounding boxes, obtain object shapes by using segmentation techniques
